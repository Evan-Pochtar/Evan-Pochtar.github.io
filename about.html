          <h1>Who Am I?</h1>
          <p>
            I'm Evan Pochtar, a 21-year-old master's graduate in Computer
            Science from the University of Minnesota, specializing in artificial
            intelligence, machine learning, and software engineering.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            I was drawn to computer science in the first place because of its
            remarkable interdisciplinary nature. From biology and chemistry to
            English and construction, technology touches virtually every aspect
            of our world. This versatility led me first to my bachelor's degree
            and now to graduate studies, where I find work on trying to bridge
            the realm of theory and practice. My college experience has been
            transformative, it has offered not only academic growth but
            opportunities to connect with people like me, as well as those who
            have studied and researched for years in the field. I approach
            education as an ongoing journey which I am far from done with, as I
            have a lot left to learn. I look forward to continuing to develop
            and learn both professionally and personally, and would love to
            connect with others who share similar interests.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Beyond academics, I maintain a balanced lifestyle. I enjoy exploring
            research papers at the intersection of computing and life sciences,
            and have a passion for history and geography. For relaxation, I
            divide my time between fiction novels, video games, and cardio
            exercise, particularly running and biking. As a Ukrainian immigrant,
            growing up between two cultures and transitioning from Russian to
            English has given me valuable perspective on the importance of
            language and communication. This background has fostered my love for
            reading and writing across genres. Technical papers, as well as
            research papers have been a big part of my academic life, and I hope
            to continue to explore the world of research and writing in the
            future both in and out of school. Fiction reading has also been a
            big part of my life, and I have a passion for exploring a variety of
            genres, including science fiction, fantasy, and historical fiction,
            and I am always on the lookout for new recommendations.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            My professional interests span Software Engineering, Machine
            Learning, Computer Vision, Bioinformatics, and Full-Stack
            Development. I have worked two internships, both focusing on
            full-stack development, and have experience with a variety of
            programming languages, testing frameworks, databases, and frontend
            frameworks. I am always eager to learn new technologies and improve
            my skills, and I am particularly interested in the intersection of
            machine learning and software engineering. Testing, debugging, and
            writing clean code are all important to me, and I strive to write
            code that is not only functional but also easy to read and maintain.
          </p>

              As someone who thrives on having a calender and a set schedule of
              things I want to do for the day, I find myself loving activities
              like biking and running that I can do everyday and feel a little
              more awake. Whether it's taking a jog outside on a good day,
              running on the treadmill, or using the elliptical, cardio has
              become an important part for my daily routine and me in general.
              What I love most about these workouts is how they help me stay
              focused while also providing a sense of relaxation and time to
              think. Maintaining a consistent exercise schedule has been
              fantastic for both my physical and mental well-being, it's just
              challenging enough to feel rewarding, but not so intense that it
              leaves me exhausted. I also do enjoy weight training a few times a
              week, making sure I don't neglect other parts of my body, however
              it doesn't scratch the same daily itch that cardio does. The
              mental clarity I get from my daily cardio sessions has helped me
              stay energized and feel amazing for a very long time now.
