        <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
        <p>
          Hello! I'm Evan Pochtar, a 21-year-old master's student at the University of Minnesota, where I'm pursuing a degree in Computer Science with a focus on Artificial Intelligence and Software Engineering.
          One of the reasons I came into the field of Computer science is as soon as I first looked at Computer Science, I realized just how many fields and topics it involves.
          From learning Biology and Chemistry to learning English and Construction, code is involved in so many steps of life that I had never seen before.
          Trying to learn more about all these branches that Computer Science can go into, was one of the reasons I went for a bachelors, but even after that I felt I could learn so much more.
          I find a sense of fulfillment from combining theory with practice, whether it's through developing solutions or going into research that pushes the boundaries of what technology can do, which is a large reason I am going for my Masters degree.
          Having said that, my specific personal professional interests are Software Engineering, Classical Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Computer Vision, Bioinformatics, and Full-Stack Development, because of this wide range these topics can be involved in.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
          Outside the classroom, I'm a naturally curious person who enjoys maintaining a balance between academic and physical pursuits.
          I love reading research papers, particularly in the fields of biology, genetics, and deep learning, as I'm very interested by the intersection of computation and life sciences.
          I also have a deep appreciation for history and geography and often losing myself in books or documentaries that explore the world.
          When it comes to leisure, I enjoy reading fiction novels that really gets me involved in their world, as well as playing video games as a way to relax and be social.
          At the same time, I'm a big fan of cardio exercise, especially running and biking, which helps me stay focused and energized.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
          I come from an immigrant family from Ukraine, and my early years were shaped by the experience of being in the middle of two cultures.
          My first language was Russian, but I transitioned to English early on, which gave me a lot of perspective on just how much culture and language matter in the world.
          This specifically inspiried my love for reading and writing which has always been a personal passion, whether it's creative, technical, or academic. 
          I find it to be very theraputic to lay down thoughts on a page, no matter what they are.
          For this and so many other reasons, I've genuinely enjoyed my time in college. 
          Not only for the academic challenges but also for the opportunity to grow as a person and connect with peers who share similar ambitions.
          For me, education has been about more than just learning. It's been a journey of discovery, curiosity, and growth that I look forward to continuing in the years ahead.

                    Against the Grain by James C. Scott completely changed how I think about the early days of human civilization.
                    Instead of the usual story that farming and settling down were the keys to progress and a better life, Scott shows that things were a lot messier—and not always better.
                    He explains how early agrarian states relied on controlling people, livestock, and grains, and how this shift led to big problems like disease, forced labor, and reliance on vulnerable crops like wheat and millet.
                    What I found most interesting was the idea that many people avoided farming and sedentary life for as long as they could because hunting, gathering, and moving around often made for a healthier and freer existence.
                    Scott also digs into the struggles between states and the so-called “barbarians” who lived outside their control, which gave me a whole new perspective on how history unfolded.
                    The book is packed with fascinating insights, and I really appreciated how Scott explains complex ideas in a way that's easy to follow but still makes you think deeply.
                    It's a great read if you're curious about where we came from and how we got here.

                    My personal favorite time period to study is the renaissance period in China and Europe, because it is much more interesting of an era than I've been told in history class as a kid.
                    Both regions were experiencing extreme transformations, largely independent of each other, yet solving similar challenges in creative ways.
                    In Europe, the upper class created "cabinets of curiosities", early versions of modern museums where scientific specimens shared space with magical artifacts like "unicorn horns" (actually narwhal tusks).
                    Meanwhile, China undertook massive projects like the Yongle Encyclopedia and developed practices we use today in language, including the sign language system used by workers in noisy factories.
                    It really impresses me just how much of our current basic science was created 600 years ago, and how influential it is today.
                    We all hear about the amazing art that was created, the writings of Shakespeare, or some of the inventions of Leonardo da Vinci, but there is so much more to learn about the time period than just that.

            As someone who thrives on having a calender and a set schedule of things I want to do for the day, I find myself loving activities like biking and running that I can do everyday and feel a little more awake.
            Whether it's taking a jog outside on a good day, running on the treadmill, or using the elliptical, cardio has become an important part for my daily routine and me in general.
            What I love most about these workouts is how they help me stay focused while also providing a sense of relaxation and time to think.
            Maintaining a consistent exercise schedule has been fantastic for both my physical and mental well-being, it's just challenging enough to feel rewarding, but not so intense that it leaves me exhausted.
            I also do enjoy weight training a few times a week, making sure I don't neglect other parts of my body, however it doesn't scratch the same daily itch that cardio does.
            The mental clarity I get from my daily cardio sessions has helped me stay energized and feel amazing for a very long time now.
