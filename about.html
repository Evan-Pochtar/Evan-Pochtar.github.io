        <h1>Who Am I?</h1>
        <p>
          I'm Evan Pochtar, a 21-year-old Master's student in Computer Science at the University of Minnesota, specializing in Artificial Intelligence, Machine learning, and Software Engineering.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
          I was drawn to computer science in the first place because of its remarkable interdisciplinary nature. 
          From biology and chemistry to English and construction, technology touches virtually every aspect of our world. 
          This versatility led me first to my bachelor's degree and now to graduate studies, where I find work on trying to bridge the realm of theory and practice. 
          My college experience has been transformative, it has offered not only academic growth but opportunities to connect with people like me, as well as those who have studied and researched for years in the field. 
          I approach education as an ongoing journey which I am far from done with, as I have a lot left to learn.
          I look forward to continuing to develop and learn both professionally and personally, and would love to connect with others who share similar interests.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
          Beyond academics, I maintain a balanced lifestyle. 
          I enjoy exploring research papers at the intersection of computing and life sciences, and have a passion for history and geography. 
          For relaxation, I divide my time between fiction novels, video games, and cardio exercise, particularly running and biking.
          As a Ukrainian immigrant, growing up between two cultures and transitioning from Russian to English has given me valuable perspective on the importance of language and communication. 
          This background has fostered my love for reading and writing across genres.
          Technical papers, as well as research papers have been a big part of my academic life, and I hope to continue to explore the world of research and writing in the future both in and out of school.
          Fiction reading has also been a big part of my life, and I have a passion for exploring a variety of genres, including science fiction, fantasy, and historical fiction, and I am always on the lookout for new recommendations.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
          My professional interests span Software Engineering, Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Bioinformatics, and Full-Stack Development.
          I have worked two internships, both focusing on full-stack development, and have experience with a variety of programming languages, testing frameworks, databases, and frontend frameworks.
          I am always eager to learn new technologies and improve my skills, and I am particularly interested in the intersection of machine learning and software engineering.
          Testing, debugging, and writing clean code are all important to me, and I strive to write code that is not only functional but also easy to read and maintain.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>

                    Against the Grain by James C. Scott completely changed how I think about the early days of human civilization.
                    Instead of the usual story that farming and settling down were the keys to progress and a better life, Scott shows that things were a lot messier—and not always better.
                    He explains how early agrarian states relied on controlling people, livestock, and grains, and how this shift led to big problems like disease, forced labor, and reliance on vulnerable crops like wheat and millet.
                    What I found most interesting was the idea that many people avoided farming and sedentary life for as long as they could because hunting, gathering, and moving around often made for a healthier and freer existence.
                    Scott also digs into the struggles between states and the so-called “barbarians” who lived outside their control, which gave me a whole new perspective on how history unfolded.
                    The book is packed with fascinating insights, and I really appreciated how Scott explains complex ideas in a way that's easy to follow but still makes you think deeply.
                    It's a great read if you're curious about where we came from and how we got here.

                    My personal favorite time period to study is the renaissance period in China and Europe, because it is much more interesting of an era than I've been told in history class as a kid.
                    Both regions were experiencing extreme transformations, largely independent of each other, yet solving similar challenges in creative ways.
                    In Europe, the upper class created "cabinets of curiosities", early versions of modern museums where scientific specimens shared space with magical artifacts like "unicorn horns" (actually narwhal tusks).
                    Meanwhile, China undertook massive projects like the Yongle Encyclopedia and developed practices we use today in language, including the sign language system used by workers in noisy factories.
                    It really impresses me just how much of our current basic science was created 600 years ago, and how influential it is today.
                    We all hear about the amazing art that was created, the writings of Shakespeare, or some of the inventions of Leonardo da Vinci, but there is so much more to learn about the time period than just that.

            As someone who thrives on having a calender and a set schedule of things I want to do for the day, I find myself loving activities like biking and running that I can do everyday and feel a little more awake.
            Whether it's taking a jog outside on a good day, running on the treadmill, or using the elliptical, cardio has become an important part for my daily routine and me in general.
            What I love most about these workouts is how they help me stay focused while also providing a sense of relaxation and time to think.
            Maintaining a consistent exercise schedule has been fantastic for both my physical and mental well-being, it's just challenging enough to feel rewarding, but not so intense that it leaves me exhausted.
            I also do enjoy weight training a few times a week, making sure I don't neglect other parts of my body, however it doesn't scratch the same daily itch that cardio does.
            The mental clarity I get from my daily cardio sessions has helped me stay energized and feel amazing for a very long time now.
